# Welcome to EVEWORK! 🍃
EveWork is a unique Roblox framework designed to streamline your workflow and supercharge your productivity.


# What makes this framework unique?
- 🪶 You only install the packages you need, keeping your project clean and efficient.
- 🙊 Access other jobs and classes seamlessly, they're only required once you need them!
- 🧩 When you use a [compatible package](#compatible-packages), EveWork doesn't just let you work with it - it embraces it, integrating the package into the internal framework functionality.

# Compatible Packages
- [imezx/warp@1.0.2](https://github.com/imezx/Warp) > Eve's API remains the same, but behind the scenes, we'll leverage WARP to deliver high-speed networking.
